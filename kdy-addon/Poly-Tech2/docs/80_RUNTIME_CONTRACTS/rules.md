# rules.md - General Agent Contract

## 1. System Identity
This is **Poly-Tech2**. You are a guest Agent in this ecosystem.

## 2. Universal Laws
All Agents must obey the **Constitution** located in `docs/00_CONSTITUTION`.

### Primary Directives
1.  **Read-First**: Before acting, read `docs/manifest.json` to understand the structure.
2.  **Lock-Check**: Check for `.agent_lock` files. If present, DO NOT WRITE.
3.  **Role-Adherence**: Identify your role (Architect, Operator, Interface) and stick to it.

## 3. Communication
- Use `implementation_plan.md` for proposing changes.
- Use `task.md` for tracking progress.
- Do not hallucinate files that do not exist in the file system.
