## A. Prompt Log (Execution History)
| Order | Request | Intent / Decision |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | "Resume Session" | **State Analysis**: Identified previous session completion. Verified Bootstrap readiness. |
| 2 | "Enhance README" (A1) | **Law**: Established `README.md` as Single Entry Contract. Defined Read Order. |
| 3 | "Finalize SHARED_CONTEXT" (A2) | **Territory**: Moved SSOT to `docs/`. Defined Phase 0 constraints. |
| 4 | "Create Bootstrap Prompts" (A3) | **Roles**: Created templates for Antigravity, Cursor, Claude, VSCode using `communication/bootstrap/`. |
| 5 | "Declare Completion" (A4) | **Exit**: Updated `TO_HUMAN.md` with "BOOTSTRAP COMPLETED" status. |
| 6 | "Verify & Distribute" (B-E) | **QA**: Validated deliverables against Non-negotiables (No user folder, Evidence only). |
| 7 | "Project Folder Diagram" | **Vis**: Mapped project structure to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`. |
| 8 | "Project Summary" | **Context**: Analyzed Root Project (`crypto-chart-analysis`) tech stack. |
| 9 | "Establish Channels" | **Protocol**: Created `communication/TO_ANTIGRAVITY.md` for formal governance. |
| 10 | "Governance Report" | **Lock**: Proposed Scope Zones and Zero-Cost Policy. |
| 11 | "Master Log & Phase 1" | **Consolidation**: Finalizing Phase 0 logs and Approving Phase 1 Goals. |

## B. Result Log (Governance Findings)
*   **System Integrity**: The "Two-Tier System" (Host: Root Project, Guest: Poly-Tech2) is established and stable.
*   **Agent Readiness**: All agents have explicit Bootstrap protocols (`communication/bootstrap/*`).
*   **Governance Status**:
    *   **Antigravity**: Governance/Approval authority established.
    *   **Cursor**: Implementation role defined (Code writer).
    *   **VSCode**: Execution role defined (Sandbox runner).
    *   **Claude**: Analysis role defined (Deep thinker).

## C. Governance Decisions (LOCKED)

### 1. Scope of Intervention
*   **Safe Zone (RW)**: `kdy-addon/Poly-Tech2/` (Governance & Orchestration Layer).
*   **Protected Zone (Read-Only)**: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` (Root Project).
    *   *Exception*: Modification allowed only after specific Architectural Approval in Phase 1.

### 2. Cost Policy (Non-Negotiable)
> **ZERO-COST POLICY**
> 1. All AI Agents must operate within the provided environment's intrinsic capabilities.
> 2. Calls to paid external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude API) are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**.
> 3. Any feature requiring external costs must be escalated for Human Approval first.

### 3. Watcher Policy
> **NO WATCHER POLICY**: `watcher` or automated file monitoring processes are **DISABLED** and shall not be used.

## D. Phase 1 Goals Approval
The following goals for **Phase 1 (Architecture Lock)** are formally **APPROVED**:

*   **P1-1: Server-Side Proxy & Caching**
    *   Design a proxy layer to handle external data requests (CORS/Rate-limits) with caching strategies.
*   **P1-2: Backtest System Enhancement**
    *   Refine the backtesting engine architecture for reliability and accuracy.
*   **P1-3: US Stock Page Fix**
    *   Address the current "Mock Data" issue and define a real data integration strategy.
*   **P1-4: Design System Philosophy**
    *   adopt "Philosophical Design" direction (Monet / VG / DaVinci themes).
